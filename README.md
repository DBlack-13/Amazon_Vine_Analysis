# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. This program is a service that allows manufactures and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Of the 50 different data sets we are to pick one to analysis by using PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset. As a videogamer myself, I decided to analysis the videogame data set.

### Summary
With this analysis we can see that there is a higher percentage of 5 star reviews coming from the paying parties of the program. This presents a positive bias of the program. Another analysis we could consider using would be using charts for visuals. Bar chart would be great to see other star values from 1-5.
